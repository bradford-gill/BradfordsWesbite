# Dover Iron Mill

A few days ago I took my mountain bike out to Noanet Forest outside of Boston. I was stumbled across a large mill foundation with a large cut out for an old wheel.

It was an interesting foundation and I wanted to learn some more about it. After some online research it turns out that is was an iron mill in the 1800s. The wheel was 36 feet in diameter and used to make nails. It operated for about ten years around 1920. Ultimately, the mill did not have enough consistent water flow to really turn a margin. 

After being passed around from owner to owner a bit, the mill washed out around 1876. Read more about its story in the curious yankee article below.
